# 45-Day LeetCode Challenge ðŸš€

Welcome! This repository documents my journey of solving at least one LeetCode problem every day for 45 consecutive days. This challenge was inspired by my college's Teacher's Day initiative to promote consistent problem-solving.

The primary goal is to strengthen my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms** and improve my coding skills.
